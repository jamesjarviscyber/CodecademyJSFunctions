function sayThanks() {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.')

} //the thanks function

//this code is quite boring, and is similar to before, so let's make it somewhat interesting. Let's add a silly function too.

function voucherAnnoyance(){
  console.log('It would be nice if you had not used a voucher...')
}

let customer = true;
let voucher = false;

customer ? sayThanks() : console.log('Check out our latest deals!');
voucher ? voucherAnnoyance() : console.log('');

//Something you probably won't see, but I imagine business thinks!
